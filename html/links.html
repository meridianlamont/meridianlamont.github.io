            <p>Lesson taught us about the basic HTML structure, hyperlinks and different
                kinds of lists that could be used in the structure. This lesson was put to the
                test on every page that was created for this project.

            <p>CSS was learned in our second lesson and this laid the ground
                work for the ability to create the style of the website. So, margins,
                padding, even down to the font. So this lesson has examples across every
                single page.

            <p>Lesson three taught us about page layout as well as being able to position elements 
                like the nav bar and have them stay there, or have them disappear. This float, sticky and block
                ability is seen throughout the nav bar on each page and the different in the layouts of the pages.

            <p>COLOR! That's what this lesson had. The spice of life. The zest. The finishing touches
                of something bright. My site doesn't have much color... Not because I didn't learn anything,
                but because I don't like color. There is also the addition of images as well, which is where
                much of this sites spice comes from.

            <p>I remember this lesson distinctly... Responsive design. I loved learning about it.
                Putting it in practice, very hard. Was hard when I learned it too. This site though has
                responsiveness through out it. Whether you enter through mobile and certain elements are missing 
                to ensure a clean and seamless utilization, or they scale with the browser window. Specifically,
                the responsiveness of the HOME PAGE, I am very proud of.

            <p>COLUMNS! They saved me in this. You may see columns at work on the ABOUT US page where
                I discuss Services. I was honestly very grateful for columns when designing this page.

                quite frequently in my project page. BUT there is multimedia embedded into the CONTACT US
                page and changes of color on the nav bar.

            <p>JAVASCRIPT. Java was highly useful as I created a specific concept for my
                nav bar over Spring Break. I knew an idea of what I wanted and then proceeded to
                try to find out more on how to accomplish it. That is where a lot of the Java 
                for this project comes in at.
