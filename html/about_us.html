                        <h1>Social Media Management</h1>

                        <p>Social Media Management has become something that isn't just an option,
                            it's downright necessary for your business. The ability to connect with people
                            through the internet is powerful and to be able to harness that tool can make the 
                            difference of your business being seen by thousands, possibly millions of people. 
                            We have the capability for total social overhaul, with graphics, photoshoots, design,
                            scheduling and market research.

                        <h1>Livestream Management</h1>
                
                        <p>Livestream has made everything more accessible and easier to connect with other people
                            from across the globe. But let's get real, Livestreaming, is HARD. To ensure your livestream doesn't look
                            like Grandma's Zoom call from her kitchen (we're sorry Grandma, we love you), you have to have
                            the right equipment, the knowledge of the platforms to use to broadcast AND moderation. It sounds
                            tough, but Juniper has this down to a science. We've been practicing Livestream management with some of 
                            the best even before the Pandemic, and we're here to help make your event, conference or even meetings,
                            more accessible.
